**Autocactus***

Set of microservices to autodeploy posts at cactus blog. Autodeployment is meant to be done by sending email message
to a chosen email address.

**Technology stack**

In order to implement autocactus service I will use the following software stack. First of all, Python
will be used. In the first stage of architecture development, the Celery task engine will be used. 
All received posts by email will be stored at MongoDB documents database.
